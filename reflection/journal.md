My work this week was tedious. I literally spent all the time from Thursday last class to Sunday night at 8:15pm, and I still rushed. 

I really hope to work on my speed and accuracy to deliver content throughout the rest of the semester.

I wrote all the code in 2 hours but I spend 46 waking hours thinking and designing my workflow.
